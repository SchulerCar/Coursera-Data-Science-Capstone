## Natural Language Processing (NLP) Model

*[I Will Guess the Next Word!](https://www.shinyapps.io/admin/#/application/3149794)*  implements a Natural Language Processing (NLP) *n-gram* algorithm to predict (*guess*) the next word in a partial sentence

- The *guess* is based on a probabilistic language model: the probability of the *guess* is conditioned on the *N* previous words.

- Probability tables are generated from a text [corpus](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip). They are adjusted (smoothed) using a variant of the [Knesser-Ney algorithm](http://www2.denizyuret.com/ref/goodman/chen-goodman-99.pdf) and furhter interpolated using [stupid backoff](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf)

- Words with counts below a pareto threshold are replaced by an *unknown word token*. This allows predicting words for sentences including terms not trained into the model.


## Performance

- The model was trained using **2 million sentences** sampled from the SwiftKey corpus provided.  

- Probability tables were constructed for n-grams with N ranging from 1 to 6.

- Training of the model took about two hours. 

- The training data file has a size of 14.2 MB (compressed). Once loaded in memory, the data frame (*"bag of words"*) expands to 258 MB.

- The time required by the app to calculate probabilities to *guess* the next word using the frequency tables is about 0.30s.


## Shiny Application and Source Code

- The shiny application is available at
https://schulercar.shinyapps.io/Coursera-Data-Science-Capstone

- The source code is available from the github repository 
https://github.com/SchulerCar/Coursera-Data-Science-Capstone


## Instructions to Run The Application 

- Access to the application via this [url](https://schulercar.shinyapps.io/Coursera-Data-Science-Capstone)
- Type the partial sentence for which you want a prediction
- When you pause typing, the app will *guess* the next word.  It will display the most probable guess, as well as four runners-up
